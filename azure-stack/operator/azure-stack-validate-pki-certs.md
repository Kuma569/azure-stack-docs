# Validate Azure Stack Hub PKI certificates

The Azure Stack Hub Readiness Checker tool described in this article is available [from the PowerShell Gallery](https://aka.ms/AzsReadinessChecker). You can use the tool to validate that  the [generated PKI certificates](azure-stack-get-pki-certs.md) are suitable for pre-deployment. Validate certificates by leaving  enough time to test and reissue certificates if necessary.

The Readiness Checker tool performs the following certificate validations:

- **Parse PFX**  
    Checks for valid PFX file, correct password, and whether the public information is protected by the password. 
- **Expiry Date**  
    Checks for minimum validity of 7 days. 
- **Signature algorithm**  
    Checks that the signature algorithm isn't SHA1.
- **Private Key**  
    Checks that the private key is present and is exported with the local machine attribute. 
- **Cert chain**  
    Checks certificate chain is intact including a check for self-signed certificates.
- **DNS names**  
    Checks the SAN contains relevant DNS names for each endpoint, or if a supporting wildcard is present.
- **Key usage**  
    Checks if the key usage contains a digital signature and key encipherment and enhanced key usage contains server authentication and client authentication.
- **Key size**  
    Checks if the key size is 2048 or larger.
- **Chain order**  
    Checks the order of the other certificates validating that the order is correct.
- **Other certificates**  
    Ensure no other certificates have been packaged in PFX other than the relevant leaf certificate and its chain.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The PKI certificate is a PFX file and password should be treated as sensitive information.

## Prerequisites

Your system should meet the following prerequisites before validating PKI certificates for an Azure Stack Hub deployment:

- Microsoft Azure Stack Hub Readiness Checker
- SSL Certificate(s) exported following the [preparation instructions](azure-stack-prepare-pki-certs.md)
- DeploymentData.json
- Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016

## Perform core services certificate validation

Use these steps to prepare and to validate the Azure Stack Hub PKI certificates for deployment and secret rotation:

1. Install **AzsReadinessChecker** from a PowerShell prompt (5.1 or above), by running the following cmdlet:

    ```powershell  
        Install-Module Microsoft.AzureStack.ReadinessChecker -force 
    ```

2. Create the certificate directory structure. In the example below, you can change `<C:\Certificates\Deployment>` to a new directory path of your choice.
    ```powershell  
    New-Item C:\Certificates\Deployment -ItemType Directory
    
    $directories = 'ACSBlob', 'ACSQueue', 'ACSTable', 'Admin Extension Host', 'Admin Portal', 'ARM Admin', 'ARM Public', 'KeyVault', 'KeyVaultInternal', 'Public Extension Host', 'Public Portal'
    
    $destination = 'C:\Certificates\Deployment'
    
    $directories | % { New-Item -Path (Join-Path $destination $PSITEM) -ItemType Directory -Force}
    ```
    
    > [!Note]  
    > AD FS and Graph are required if you are using AD FS as your identity system. For example:
    >
    > ```powershell  
    > $directories = 'ACSBlob', 'ACSQueue', 'ACSTable', 'ADFS', 'Admin Extension Host', 'Admin Portal', 'ARM Admin', 'ARM Public', 'Graph', 'KeyVault', 'KeyVaultInternal', 'Public Extension Host', 'Public Portal'
    > ```
    
     - Place your certificate(s) in the appropriate directories created in the previous step. For example:  
        - `C:\Certificates\Deployment\ACSBlob\CustomerCertificate.pfx`
        - `C:\Certificates\Deployment\Admin Portal\CustomerCertificate.pfx`
        - `C:\Certificates\Deployment\ARM Admin\CustomerCertificate.pfx`

3. In the PowerShell window, change the values of **RegionName** and **FQDN** appropriate to the Azure Stack Hub environment and run the following:

    ```powershell  
    $pfxPassword = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter PFX Password" -AsSecureString 
    Invoke-AzsCertificateValidation -CertificateType Deployment -CertificatePath C:\Certificates\Deployment -pfxPassword $pfxPassword -RegionName east -FQDN azurestack.contoso.com -IdentitySystem AAD  
    ```

4. Check the output and all certificates pass all tests. For example:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-AzsCertificateValidation v1.1912.1082.37 started.
    Testing: KeyVaultInternal\adminvault.pfx
    Thumbprint: B1CB76****************************565B99
            Expiry Date: OK
            Signature Algorithm: OK
            DNS Names: OK
            Key Usage: OK
            Key Length: OK
            Parse PFX: OK
            Private Key: OK
            Cert Chain: OK
            Chain Order: OK
            Other Certificates: OK
    Testing: ARM Public\management.pfx
    Thumbprint: 44A35E****************************36052A
            Expiry Date: OK
            Signature Algorithm: OK
            DNS Names: OK
            Key Usage: OK
            Key Length: OK
            Parse PFX: OK
            Private Key: OK
            Cert Chain: OK
            Chain Order: OK
            Other Certificates: OK
    Testing: Admin Portal\adminportal.pfx
    Thumbprint: 3F5E81****************************9EBF9A
            Expiry Date: OK
            Signature Algorithm: OK
            DNS Names: OK
            Key Usage: OK
            Key Length: OK
            Parse PFX: OK
            Private Key: OK
            Cert Chain: OK
            Chain Order: OK
            Other Certificates: OK
    Testing: Public Portal\portal.pfx

    Log location (contains PII): C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\AzsReadinessChecker\AzsReadinessChecker.log
    Report location (contains PII): C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\AzsReadinessChecker\AzsReadinessCheckerReport.json
    Invoke-AzsCertificateValidation Completed
    ```

    To validate certificates for other Azure Stack Hub services change the value for ```-CertificateType```. For example:

    ```powershell  
    # App Services
    Invoke-AzsCertificateValidation -CertificateType AppServices -CertificatePath C:\Certificates\AppServices -pfxPassword $pfxPassword -RegionName east -FQDN azurestack.contoso.com

    # DBAdapter
    Invoke-AzsCertificateValidation -CertificateType DBAdapter -CertificatePath C:\Certificates\DBAdapter -pfxPassword $pfxPassword -RegionName east -FQDN azurestack.contoso.com

    # EventHubs
    Invoke-AzsCertificateValidation -CertificateType EventHubs -CertificatePath C:\Certificates\EventHubs -pfxPassword $pfxPassword -RegionName east -FQDN azurestack.contoso.com

    # IoTHub
    Invoke-AzsCertificateValidation -CertificateType IoTHub -CertificatePath C:\Certificates\IoTHub -pfxPassword $pfxPassword -RegionName east -FQDN azurestack.contoso.com
    ```
Each folder should contain a single PFX file for the certificate type, if a certificate type has multi-certificate requirements nested folders for each individual certificate are expected and name sensitive.  The following code shows an example folder/certificate structure for all certificate types, and the appropriate value for ```-CertificateType``` and ```-CertificatePath```.
    
    ```powershell
    C:\>tree c:\SecretStore /A /F
        Folder PATH listing
        Volume serial number is 85AE-DF2E

    ```

### Known issues

**Symptom**: Tests are skipped

**Cause**: AzsReadinessChecker skips certain tests if a dependency isn't met:

 - Other certificates are skipped if certificate chain fails.

    ```powershell  
    Testing: ACSBlob\singlewildcard.pfx
        Read PFX: OK
        Signature Algorithm: OK
        Private Key: OK
        Cert Chain: OK
        DNS Names: Fail
        Key Usage: OK
        Key Size: OK
        Chain Order: OK
        Other Certificates: Skipped
    Details:
    The certificate records '*.east.azurestack.contoso.com' do not contain a record that is valid for '*.blob.east.azurestack.contoso.com'. Please refer to the documentation for how to create the required certificate file.
    The Other Certificates check was skipped because Cert Chain and/or DNS Names failed. Follow the guidance to remediate those issues and recheck.

    Report location (contains PII): C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\AzsReadinessChecker\AzsReadinessCheckerReport.json
    Invoke-AzsCertificateValidation Completed
    ```

**Resolution**: Follow the tool's guidance in the details section under each set of tests for each certificate.

| Public Portal  |  portal_\<region>_\<externalFQDN> |

## Using validated certificates

Once your certificates have been validated by the AzsReadinessChecker, you are ready to use them in your Azure Stack Hub deployment or for Azure Stack Hub secret rotation. 

 - For deployment, securely transfer your certificates to your deployment engineer so that they can copy them onto the deployment host as specified in the [Azure Stack Hub PKI requirements documentation](azure-stack-pki-certs.md).
 - For secret rotation, you can use the certificates to update old certificates for your Azure Stack Hub environment's public infrastructure endpoints by following the [Azure Stack Hub Secret Rotation documentation](azure-stack-rotate-secrets.md).
 - For PaaS services, you can use the certificates to install SQL, MySQL, and App Services Resource Providers in Azure Stack Hub by following the [Overview of offering services in Azure Stack Hub documentation](service-plan-offer-subscription-overview.md).
